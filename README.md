## M5StickV Description

M5Stack recently launched the new AIoT(AI+IoT) Camera powered by Kendryte K210 -an edge computing system-on-chip(SoC) with dual-core 64bit RISC-V CPU and advanced neural network processor..

M5StickV AI Camera possesses machine vision capabilities, equips OmniVision OV7740 image sensor, adopts OmniPixel®3-HS technology, provides optimum low light sensitivity, supports various vision identification capabilities. (e.g. Real-time acquisition of the size, type and coordinates of the detected target ) In addition to an OV7740 sensor, M5StickV features more hardware resources such as a speaker with built-in I2S Class-D DAC, IPS screen, 6-axis IMU, 200mAh Li-po battery, and more.

It is able to perform convolutional neural network calculations at low power consumption, so M5StickV will be a good zero-threshold machine vision embedded solution. It is in support with MicroPython, which makes your code to be more concise when you use M5stick-V for programming.

> Power off: Short press power button for 6 seconds

## M5UnitV Description

UnitV is the new AI Camera powered by Kendryte K210, an edge computing system-on-chip(SoC) with dual-core 64bit RISC-V CPU and state-of-art neural network processor.

UNIT-V AI Camera features its integration with machine vision capabilities, featuring the unprocessed acceptability to AI Visioning with high energy efficiency and low cost. We co-oped with Sipeed providing the MicroPython environment makes programming on UNIT-V easier.

Support MicroPython development environment, which makes the program code more concise when you use UNIT-V for project development.Equipped with OV2640/OV7740 image sensor, it is an ideal choice for machine vision project.

It is equipped with two programmable keys and an RGB LED indicator on the front for convenient status display.At the bottom, there is a HY2.0*4P interface and a type-C interface compatible with grove, which is convenient to connect with the main controller. Support TF card to expand memory, related material and model file call more convenient.
